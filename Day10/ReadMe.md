# 🚀 Day 10: Functions with Outputs & Calculator Project 🎯

## 📌 Overview
Today’s focus is on **functions with outputs** in Python. We explored multiple return values, docstrings, and practical applications—culminating in building a **fully functional calculator**! 🧮

## 📝 Topics Covered:
- **Functions with Outputs**: Writing functions that return values rather than just performing actions.
- **Multiple Return Values**: Learning how functions can return more than one value.
- **Docstrings**: Properly documenting functions for better readability and maintainability.
- **Calculator Project**: Implementing a simple yet interactive calculator using functions.

## 🔍 Files in this Repo:
### 1️⃣ `Calculator.py` 🧮
A **simple calculator** that:
- Supports **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.
- Uses a dictionary to map operations to functions.
- Handles **division by zero** gracefully.
- Allows continuous calculations with the last result.

📌 **Usage:**  
Run the script, input two numbers, and choose an operation. You can continue calculations or start fresh.

```python
# Example Usage
What is the first number?: 10
Pick an operation: +
What's the next number?: 5
10 + 5 = 15
```

### 2️⃣ `Title_case.py` 🔤
A function that **formats names correctly** by capitalizing the first letter.

📌 **Features:**
- Takes **first and last name** as input.
- Returns a properly formatted full name.
- Handles empty inputs with an error message.

```python
# Example Usage
What's your first name? john
What's your last name? doe
Output: John Doe
```

## 🧑‍💻 Key Learnings:
✅ **Returning values** makes functions more flexible.  
✅ **Docstrings** improve readability and help document your functions.  
✅ **Using dictionaries with functions** allows for **dynamic operation selection**.  
✅ **Handling user input errors** (like division by zero) is crucial for robust programs.
