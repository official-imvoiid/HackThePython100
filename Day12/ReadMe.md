# 🎯 Day 12 - Number Guessing Game 🎯

Welcome to **Day 12** of *HackThePython100*! This project is a simple **Number Guessing Game** built in Python. The user must guess a randomly generated number within a set number of attempts. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

## 🛠 **Features**
✔️ Random number generation (1 - 100).  
✔️ Two difficulty levels: **Easy** (10 attempts) & **Hard** (5 attempts).  
✔️ Feedback on every guess: *Too High* / *Too Low*.  
✔️ ASCII Art Logo for a stylish look.  
✔️ Fully interactive command-line gameplay.

## 📜 **How to Play**

   ```
3. Enter **'easy'** or **'hard'** to set the difficulty.
4. Start guessing! The game will tell you if your guess is *Too High* or *Too Low*.
5. If you guess the correct number, you win! Otherwise, the game ends when you run out of attempts.
